    <p><em>In Another World With My Smartphone</em> has <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoadsandLoadsOfCharacters" target="_blank">loads and loads of characters</a>, most of them minor, and they like to pop up here and there witout prior warning. This tool is meant to help you find characters from previous books without having to google it and expose yourself to who knows what spoilers. You can also use the tags to navigate character types.</p>

    <p>So, need a refresher on who's Leim, who's Laim, who's Lain and who's Leen? Go right ahead. Feeling a bit confused on who's Fleur and who's Flora? Suffer no more. Can't remember who this Sylvie who just appeared was? Get yourself sorted.</p>

    <p><strong>Start by choosing up to which book you've read with the slider below.</strong> Everything is book-scoped, so the information will change accordingly.</p>
