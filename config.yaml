You can also use the tags to navigate character types.</p>

    <p>So, need a refresher on who's Leim, who's Laim, who's Lain and who's Leen? Go right ahead. Feeling a bit confused on who's Fleur and who's Flora? Suffer no more. Can't remember who this Sylvie who just appeared was? Get yourself sorted.</p>
