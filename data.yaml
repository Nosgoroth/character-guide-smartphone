# An array of characters. Each character takes the following form:
#
#  - name: Foo @5: Bar
#    book: 5
#    tags: lorem, ipsum@5, dolor
#    blurb: This. @5: And also that.
#
# Notes on each:
#   Both "name" and "blurb" are versionable strings (see below).
#   "tags" is a list of tags, comma-separated.
#     In the example, haracter has the tags "lorem", "dolor" and,
#     from volume 5 onwards, also "ipsum".
#   "book" is a simple number defining the first book the character appears in. It can
#     be ommited and it defaults to 1.
#
# Versionable string:
#   "This. @5: And also that. @$9: This, that and the other thing."
#     => It's "This." until volume 5, then it becomes "This. And also that."
#     => After volume 9 it becomes "This, that and the other thing."
#
#   That is to say:
#     => Use "A @5: B" to have "A" become "A B" after the given volume.
#     => Use "A @$5: B" to have "A" become "B" after the given volume.
